# Week 4 - Introduction to PyTorch

## Plan for the Week
- Deep learning frameworks
- PyTorch
  - torch.tensor
  - Computational graph
  - Automatic differentiation (torch.autograd)
  - Data loading and preprocessing (torch.utils)
  - Useful functions (torch.nn.functional)
  - Creating the model (torch.nn)
  - Optimizers (torch.optim)
  - Save/load models
- Miscellaneous

## Reading material
- Lecture Notes https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/v20/material/lectureslides/in5400_week4_2020_pytorch_lecture4.pdf

## Resources
- Pytorch tutorials: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
  - Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html

- Pytorch cheat sheet: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ptcheat.html
- Broadcasting: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html

- Awesome PyTorch list: https://github.com/bharathgs/Awesome-PyTorch-list
  It is a collection of hundred of links, including tutorials, research papers, libraries, etc.

- Note:
  Donâ€™t get confused. A lot of the available code online is written in an older version of PyTorch (mostly in 0.3-0.4).
